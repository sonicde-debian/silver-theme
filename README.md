# Silver

<a name="overview"/>

## Overview

_Silver_ is a fork of _Klassy_ which is a theming utility for the KDE Desktop Environment. This one is modified specifically to use new features specific to SonicDE. It consists of a Global Theme which applies several components: Window Decoration, Application Style, Colour Scheme, Desktop style, and Icons. The Silver Application Style has arguably the best scrollbars on any platform.

### Main _Silver_ global theme

After [installing](#installation), it is recommended to first try the main Global Theme, called _Silver_.

The global theme is enabled in System Settings->Colours & Themes->Global Theme. NB: you need to initially use the Global Theme settings screen to apply the theme properly; if you intially apply via the Quick Settings screen or the Light/Dark selector then the full Desktop & window layout will not be applied. Afterwards, you can set Light/Dark switching for day/night, respectively.

Left panel theme selection (recommended for 16:9 laptops):

Bottom panel theme selection (recommended for everything else):
![Bottom panel dark/light theme selection](screenshots/bottom_panel_light_dark.png?raw=true "Bottom panel dark/light theme selection")

The default _Silver_ theme is designed to be pragmatic for long-term every-day use, not for instant likes on social media or "ricing" sites. _Silver_ is based on the work of Paul A McAuley who evolved the _Klassy_ theme to be arguably more polished and usable than _Breeze_, with influences from the original Breeze design, the "Blue Ocean" refresh, and the original KDE 1.

## Customizability

_Silver_ is highly customizable - you can make your system as classy or unclassy as you like!

For easy customization, the _Silver Settings_ GUI application is installed. `silver-settings` also has command-line options to allow Preset file imports, load Presets and generate system icons. Run `silver-settings --help` for details.

It is recommended to first try the bundled Presets in Silver Settings before any fine-tuning:
![Preset selection](screenshots/presets_silver.png?raw=true "Preset selection")

* Provides numerous built-in perfectly-pixel-snapped button icons, as well as the ability to display `window-*-symbolic` system icons:
  ![Screenshot of Button icons menu](screenshots/button_icon_menu.png?raw=true "Screenshot of Button icons menu")

* Provides an Application Style aso that icons in dockable panels, MDI applications and application tabs are consistent (make sure to enable the _Silver_ Application Style):

* Provides an Icon theme so that context menus and GTK applications consistently match the main titlebar icons (make sure to enable the _Silver_ system icon theme and configure the icons by clicking "System Icon Generation..." in _Silver Settings_):

* Configurable button size, shape, translucency, colours and outlining.

* Default buttons are "Integrated Rounded Rectangles" with translucent outlined accent colours, with a large clickable area. These are designed to complement the "Blue Ocean" design refresh, along with the system accent colour feature. Shown below with _Klasse_ icons (inspired by KDE1):

* Alternative "Traffic lights" background colours:

* Alternative "Full-height Rounded Rectangle" button shape (_ClassiK v3_ preset):

   ![Turquoise button style, dark](screenshots/highlight_gifs/tdark.gif?raw=true "Turquoise button style, dark")![Turquoise button style, light](screenshots/highlight_gifs/tlight.gif?raw=true "Turquoise button style, light")

* Full-height Rectangular (_ClassikStyles_ preset) or Circular (_Classik-Aurorae_ preset) button highlights:
   ![Full-height Rectangle button highlight style, inheriting system highlight colours](screenshots/highlight_gifs/squareHighlight.gif?raw=true "Full-height Rectangle button highlight style, inheriting system highlight colours")![Circle button highlight style, inheriting system highlight colours](screenshots/highlight_gifs/circleHighlight.gif?raw=true "Circle button highlight style, inheriting system highlight colours")

* Ability to inherit system colour-scheme highlight colours for hover and focus, as well as titlebar colour. Auto-enhances contrast in cases where it is poor.
* Option to have matching titlebar colour and border colour.

* Configurable button spacing (left and right), titlebar margins (sides, top/bottom and option for different maximized), corner radius; all with scaling for HiDPI:

![Screenshot of Alignment & Spacing tab](screenshots/alignment_and_spacing.png?raw=true "Screenshot of Alignment & Spacing tab")

* Transparency/opacity configurable for both active/inactive titlebars/headers; setting to make maximized windows opaque; blur is configurable.

* Configurable thin window outline with optional accent colours:

![Composite screenshot of thin window outlines with Contrast blended with accent colour (dark)](screenshots/thin_window_outline_dark_contrast_accent.png?raw=true "Composite screenshot of thin window outlines with Contrast blended with accent colour (dark)")

* Configurable scrollbars:
